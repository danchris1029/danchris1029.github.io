	<p>Hello, my name is Christian Guardiola, and this website currently is under construction. I’m doing my own research on how I can make it look like a blogger’s website without having to put together unnecessary amounts of code when there are developer tools among other open-sourced resources on the web that I can use to my disposal (because building this website from bare HTML code is like reinventing the wheel with a pair of chopsticks, and that’s just not productive)</p>
