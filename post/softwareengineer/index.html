<h1 id="the-confusion-before-the-experience">The Confusion Before The Experience</h1>
<p>To fully understand just a bit of the abstracted map of the field of Software Engineering, I think that a person should gain experience in some of its branches which gives them atleast a fundamental understanding of each one.</p>
<h1 id="the-software-developer">The Software Developer</h1>
<p>This person would work on the main portion of a software application. Also, it&rsquo;s a plus if whatever they develop can be run on any platform or be easily integrated into a web application (but that may be asking a bit too much during the first versions of the application). Although software development is a muscle that can be strenghtend through experience, just like any other engineer who deals with developing the architecture of a structure, <a href="https://blog.devmountain.com/web-development-vs-software-development-which-is-the-better-career-choice/">software developers require the proper schooling</a> to instill the right theories and methodologies needed to contrust effiecient and reliable software applications.</p>
<h1 id="the-web-developer">The Web Developer</h1>
<p>Another branch that stems from software engineering is web development. We can go even further by seperating them into back-end or front-end developers (although full-stack developers exist <a href="https://www.themartec.com/insidelook/full-stack-developer-myth">but might be a bit more rare</a>).</p>

<p>Litterally just programming? To be continued</p>
